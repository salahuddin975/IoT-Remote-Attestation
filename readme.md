# Remote Attestation Testbed

## About
We build a IoT testbed to experiment with vulnerability exploitation and remote attestation of IoT devices.
There are two primary files: 

1. A testbed server that starts and terminate different IoT projects
2. A Client that exploits particular vulnerable project by sending payload remotely

## Setup
We will provide details later

## Run Server Side
Select any of the included projects after running the server
```
$ ./testbed.sh
```

## Run Client Side
Select particular project and related exploit after running the client
```
$ ./client
```
